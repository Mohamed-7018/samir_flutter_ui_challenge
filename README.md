# samir_flutter_ui_challenge

On the way to success, it is always us, not me.

When I saw the idea of a group of UI / UX developers who decided to make a challenge to share a new design of thier work daily, as some sort of inspiration source or a thread of ideas for others. 

This idea made me excited to do a flutter UI Challenge â€¦ The challenge is to act as a virtual team, that works togehter on custom painted flutter animations and awesome UIs, that are distinctive and have a solid shape, they will collected in one repo built Like a kit, which might help in the future projects.

Something like this is hard to be done alone, so the team work will help collecting more UIs and animations.
